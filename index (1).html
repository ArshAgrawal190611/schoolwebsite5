        <p class="text muted">Church and school are two of the biggest parts of my life. My first memories are going to church and school, because that is all I’ve ever focused on. I don’t play sports, so I spend my free nights after school and weekends studying for tests and going to church.  My summers consist of working and volunteering in church programs. My biggest priority in life will always be excelling in my faith and learning to work as a team. One quality that has always stuck with me through the 17 years of my life is leadership. Whether it was me organizing the games my sister and I would play when we were younger, or being the one person to start a class discussion on the first day of school when everyone else was too shy to muster something up.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">In my school library, we have various types of books- fictional, non-fictional, literature, books on general knowledge, etc. I love to read storybooks and books on general knowledge which have colourful illustrations. Books in my school library are arranged in such a way that students can find them easily.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">School auditoriums have now been quite common in many schools of the subcontinent. This trend makes the topic important for English comprehension tests such as report writing. Such reports are generally written in the pattern of magazine reports but can also be framed in the pattern of newspaper reports in some cases.

          In today's session, I am going to show exactly how you can write a report on the inauguration of the school auditorium in both the relevant patterns. For your initial clarification, three sample reports will be written on the magazine report pattern, and one will be a newspaper report. The category of every report will be mentioned prior to the samples.</p>

    <p class="text-primary">All work and no play make Jack a dull boy”. Games and sports are an integral part of education. They assist in the overall development of a child. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body, sports and games keep a student physically healthy and fit. Moreover, merely bookish knowledge will produce only bookworms. Hence, sports have become an essential part of the curriculum of schools everywhere.

      Our school too stresses upon this aspect of education and provides coaching to various sports to help students develop interest towards sports. We have games like Crickets, Hockey, Basket Ball, Volley Ball, Table Tennis, Athletics and Gymnastics –a wide variety from which the students can choose according to their interests.</p>

    <p class="text-primary"> Inter-school competitions are held on various topics, throughout the year involving several schools. This is a very healthy thing as a student is assessed, not only within the school, but is compared with the students of all the other schools too. These competitions give the younger generation a boost and raise their confidence while progressively developing a positive attitude towards competitions.</p>
